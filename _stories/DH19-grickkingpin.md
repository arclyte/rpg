## Summary

Grick engaged in some midget poo wrestling against his drow adversaries, attacking from below to drag them down into the muck with him.

After defeating the drow, some of the party briefly hinted at the idea of absconding with the smuggler's goods. Grick decided that if there were drugs to be sold that it'd be better that he was in charge of distributing them.

The party interrogated the one drow they didn't kill and learned that the leader of the group, Xzand’re Hsyl’ran, had been disguising herself as Meggin of the Ship's Prow as a cover for her smuggling operation.  She ran the operation in hopes of impressing her former boss in the Bregan D'aerthe. The drow was uncertain if that was, in fact, Jarlaxle, the group's leader, but said that her contact was someone within the Sea Maidens Faire in the Docks Ward.

Upon examining the former leader's person, Footsteps found a fancy silk and gold threaded headband that later turned out to be a minor magical item. He also found two of the false maps and a letter in one of her pockets.

Unsure of what to do with their captive, Grick pushed him into the sewage and left, with the rest of the party not far behind.

I think Footsteps put it best when he said:

Veldrin has been killed twice. I've been beat the hell up and got the poop touch from Grick. Grick has been fudge-gurgling all night. Aradaine forgot how a sword works. Hamidal does 2 damage all the time.

We suck.
