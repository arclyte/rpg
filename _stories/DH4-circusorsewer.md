## Summary

The party finds the warehouse and smashes through a window in the yard. They enter to find bodies strewn across the floor with a gang of kenku rifling through their belongings.  As they engage the kenku, a tabaxi joins the fray from above, helping them to fight off the birds.

In the aftermath, they introduce themselves to this new adventurer, who says that he's been tracking an individual who was rumored to be working with the Zhentarim. Partway through their conversation noises from a closet drew their attention.  Buried under a pile of stinking dried fish was Renear Neverember - former adventurer and son to the ousted former Open Lord Dagult Neverember.

Before they could get much out of Renaer, other than his thanks, the City Watch descended on the scene and questioned the party about what happened by the guard captain Hyustus Staget. With Renaer's help they were able to extricate them from the situation without any (immediate) repercussions. They all headed for the Yawning Portal to talk over what had happened.

Renaer told the party that his friend Floon had been kidnapped by a group of thugs who had fought the Zhentarim, and that he thinks they had mistaken Floon for him.  He was lucky enough to hide in the closet during the scuffle, but he was very worried for his friends' life.  

Continuing the search for Floon, the party found themselves in the sewers hunting down the Xanathar agents that had kidnapped him.  Secret symbols etched into the walls of the tunnels guided them deeper into the dark, filthy tunnels.  They quickly dispatched a gazer left as a guard outside of a particularly long tunnel with no walkways.

After a slog through the tunnel, the party saw an opening ahead.  Hamidal sent his familiar Gozrien, in the form of a rat, swimming ahead to check it out.  He was able to notice arrow slits in the walls where unattentive goblins sat on guard duty. Using his familiar as a proxy, Hamidal was able to take one of the goblins out while the other slept. That one was also quickly dispatched and the party found a doorway leading into a dry set of rooms.

Sneaking through the corridors, the party burst in a room to find a duergar and a human thug attempting to barricade a door across the room. Their sudden presence led them to give up on the door and attack. The duergar surprised them by growing in size to take up a good portion of the room. They put up a fight but were no match for the party.

Kael was very interested to find what it was they were trying to barricade behind the door...
