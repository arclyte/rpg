## Summary

The Manor was visited by Istrid Horn, sent by Davil Starsong (of the Zhentarim) to offer the party her moneylending services. She offered a loan of 2500 gp at a 10% flat interest rate (2750 gp total) with a 3 month term. The party thanked her but declined.
With nothing else pressing, everyone decided to follow Grick to the temple to check out this 'Order of the Gauntlet' he told everyone about. It was near the market in a building called the 'Halls of Justice'.  Grick took the oath to become a part of the order, and Savra Belabranta told Grick about a service they could do for the Order. 

Savra asked the party to help the owner of an inn in the Field Ward named the Loose Gyre who was being extorted by some thugs. The party asked about getting paid.  Savra said a loyal member of the Order could find free healing and restoration in the South Ward. This and the promise of possible plunder made the mission amenable to the rest of the party.

After a stop back at Trollskull Manor, where Hamidal equipped himself with doctor's mask, waders, and gloves, the party headed to the Field Ward.  Footsteps took food to give to the poor and did so stealthily behind the party, while Hamidal walked out front passing out silvers to a growing crowd.

At the The Loose Gyre, the party begins to unwind at the bar and ask Lara, the owner, about the trouble she's been having when in walks Gregor and his four thugs.  Gregor asks Lara for the money. Hamidal tries to defuse the situation by charming Gregor into walking away and giving back what money they had already taken - but then push the other thugs too far when they start asking for directions to their lair. Gregor was into it, but his men started pushing, and breaking furniture - that's really all they were there for.

But this wasn't the same party that fought thugs last time - now they were (((SECOND LEVEL))) and the thugs were falling fast.  Gregor high tailed it out past his last man standing yelling for him to run.  Aradaine blocked the door on him, so he jumped through the window and tried to run - only to meet the swift and deadly justice of Beshaba's blade.

There were now bodies falling on the street, people were running scared. Lara told the party to move quickly, to get away before the Watch came. They're sparse in the Field, but not for something such as this. Hamidal handed over the bag of coins Gergor had left to Lara to help her fix up what damage the thugs had done (a smashed table and broken window).  While the rest of the party... finished their drinks and picked the purses of the dead thugs? Footsteps used his Hunter's Mark on Gregor to trail him back towards his lair.  

Footsteps chased ahead of the party and found the secret entrance to the Zhent's lair in the sewers.  On coming back out of the sewers, Footsteps caught up with the rest of the party who'd lost him in the alley. During their conversation, Footsteps made a lude remark about Kael's Lady. He did not receive it well, and so Footsteps invited Kael to dinner to discuss his Lady - where he asked many questions about her and Kael's relationship to her, and apologized for his ignorance about the nature of his religion. (Kael's like - religion? She's my Lady...)

Hamidal made furious notes of this whole proceeding.  He was not deterred from his study, even when Footsteps pointedly _did not_ apologize to him _in particular_, and had some other choice words for him besides. He invited Kael to speak at some future time about Kael's remembrance of his life prior to meeting his Lady (does Hamidal have an appointment book for such things?). 

Grick was shocked to see the anger that Footsteps showed towards Hamidal. He'd watched Footsteps through the days he's known him enough to notice the difference in expression that he gives to Hamidal. And he's definitely not happy to think that there might be discord in the party. He's also not entirely sure who Kael's "Lady" might be, but is pretty sure she's one of the good ones - I mean, of course she is.

Aradaine sat quietly, absorbing the conversation.  Mostly shaking his head like - this is what I've got to work with?

After dinner, everyone headed up to tell Davil Starsong about the Zhent's they'd tussled with - and the discovery of their lair. Before striking a deal with Davil, Footsteps said that it was _he_ who knew the lair and not the rest of the party - and they'd never discussed payment for it between them.  He asked Davil for a moment to confer with his friends. Davil offered his room and said he'd attend to some other business while the party talked. Footsteps took Davil up on his offer of (two) girls, who arrived shortly after Davil left.

Once gone, the party had a quick discussion about asking Davil to be an investor, but it was quickly decided that taking the quick cash and staying independent was the way to go. When Davil came back, they agreed to take Davil's offer of 50 gp each for a map to the Zhent's lair.  Footsteps also asked Davil for some help in finding someone that he'd been searching for - as a separate concern from the deal the rest of the pary was striking. Davil was agreeable to that arrangement and asked for more details.

When asked what they'd do to the lair, Davil said he'd have some of his people look into it - assess the situation, see what intelligence they could get. Grick was a bit disappointed as he was hoping they'd storm the place themselves.  Of course, Footsteps maintains that there were 48 'dudes' inside the lair, so maybe it's not feasible to take it head on - yet... (that's three dots, but it's pronounced like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TfpDkutWG8)

Davil, content with this fortuitous information from some new recruits, plied them with as much liquor as they could drink. So the party partied like parties can party when the party's paid for by another party (it looked exactly like this - minus John Wick: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-HSoOFdJ3s).  Footsteps took a room at the 'Portal That Yawns' with his girls, where they snuggled and purred all night (no, literally) while the rest of the party headed back home to get some rest.
