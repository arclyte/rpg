    <h2 id="hamidal-rivias-eltorchul"><a href="/characters/Hamidal.html">Hamidal</a> Rivias-Eltorchul</h2>

<h1 id="bio">Bio</h1>

<p><a href="/characters/Hamidal.html">Hamidal</a> enjoys showing off, and tends to treat any interaction with others as an opportunity to do so. This showing off usually results in grandious acts of generosity that have little practical effects on the lives of the recipients. <a href="/characters/Hamidal.html">Hamidal</a> sees this as contributing to the love and respect he believes he is due because of his social status.</p>

<p><a href="/characters/Hamidal.html">Hamidal</a> is a bit of a fop, always well dressed, usually knowing when and where upcoming parties, balls and feasts are to be held. Of these, his favorites are the ones that arise around Ahghairon’s Day in Elasias. He tends to only drink socially at these events, and as necessary to keep his humors in balance of course.</p>

<p>He has never had a true “pet,” but he is fond of his familiar Gozien who usually manifests as a brown-and-grey rat.</p>

<p><a href="/characters/Hamidal.html">Hamidal</a> approaches magic similarly to how he approaches medicine - as a hard science. Magic is a thing goverened by knowable (if at times counter-intuitive) laws that can be studied and derived by experimentation. He is not strongly religious, though he respects the beliefs of others. If pressed he would express an affinity towards Mystra.</p>

<p>“<a href="/characters/Hamidal.html">Hamidal</a>” is a family name from his father’s side. He’s adopted the hyphenated last name since taking up residence in the Eltorchul household. His mother called him “Ham.” He bristles when he hears it used but he will answer to it.</p>

<p>He was born and raised in Waterdeep, and finds the city to be endlessly fascinating. He has travelled on family caravan trips short distances down the High Road and Trade Way to pick up items of interest to Lord Thesp. He has disliked “roughing it” on these trips from the very beginning and actively avoids going on them now.</p>

<p>He has had some legal problems in the past. He was the subject of an investigation several years ago after a patient of his died during a treatment for phlegatism involving the application of dry heat. The patient was a minor member of the Brossfeather family, and they pressed for an inquest. He was eventually found guilty of negligence and his family paid a small fine to the family of the man who died. Shortly after this, <a href="/characters/Hamidal.html">Hamidal</a> was “invited” to move into the Eltorchul family mansion ostensibly to apprentice under Lord Thesp. In reality this move was made to keep him out of further trouble.</p>

<p><a href="/characters/Hamidal.html">Hamidal</a> regards the whole thing as a sad and unfortunate business. He rarely treats new patients now, preferring to keep his medical work confined to advice and research.</p>

<p>His father Othiam is a spice trader and hedge wizard who married into the Eltorchul family by wedding a distant cousin of Lord Thesp. Mother Arlia was a socialite and clothing designer. <a href="/characters/Hamidal.html">Hamidal</a> is an only child. He learned the basics of magic from his father, gained an interest in medicine from an Uncle Hamdash. Lord Thesp Eltorchul has grown fond of <a href="/characters/Hamidal.html">Hamidal</a> (who he views as a “graduate assistant” sort of apprentice) but will not go too far out on a limb to help if he does something stupid. For his part, <a href="/characters/Hamidal.html">Hamidal</a> thinks highly of Thesp and cares greatly about not disappointing the man.</p>

<p><a href="/characters/Hamidal.html">Hamidal</a> supplements his stipend by taking auspices, telling fortunes, and giving medical diagnoses and advice. He has also, on occasion, been involved in minor surveillance or espionage jobs where his ability to disguise his appearance and read lips have proved valuable.</p>
